            <h1>Items</h1>
            <p>An item is a modular enhancement that the player can equip in-game, usually purchasable forgold. Items are often fashioned into objects from Runeterran lore, otherwise following the theme of the game's background setting.</p>
            <h3>Acquiring items</h3>
            <p>Items can be purchased from the shop. The player's inventory can contain up to six items and one trinket at a time, making the choice of items an important factor in a champion's efficacy.</p>

            <h3>Effects</h3>
            <p>Most items provide buffs to champions. Some buffs improve the stats of the champion, while others provide other types of benefits.</p>
            <p>Stat buffs improve the champion's statistics. Most items grant some form of stat buff.</p>
            <p>Passive effects are constantly active while the champion has the item equipped, like champion innate abilities.</p>
            <p>Auras are buffs or debuffs that affect nearby friendly or enemy units, respectively. All aura effects are unique.</p>
            <p>The holder of an aura item is not affected by the aura and thus can still benefit from an aura. This allows auras to stack up to twice on champions who possess the aura themselves. Other allies don't benefit beyond the first aura.</p>
            <p>Active effects function similarly to champion abilities. They are activated by clicking on the item or by pressing the item's hotkey. Like champion abilities, active effects have cooldowns. Once the item has been activated, it goes on cooldown and cannot be triggered again until it has come off cooldown. The cooldown of active effects is affected by item haste.</p>
            <p>Some items−such as Consumable−can utilize charges that limit the amount of activations. These charges may be restocked either automatically, or require repurchase. In the case of repurchased charges, the item will be destroyed when charges are depleted.</p>

            <h3>Classification</h3>
            <h4>Starter</h4>
            <p>These items are intended as effective starting items at the beginning of the game. These items usually do not build into higher-tier items.</p>
            <h4>Basic</h4>
            <p>These items provide a single stat attribute or special effect.</p>
            <h4>Epic</h4>
            <p>These items provide additional stats and/or a special effect. Some epic items offer lesser effects of the legendary item(s) that they build into.</p>
            <h4>Legendary</h4>
            <p>These items provide the greatest stats and a significant special effect. They do not build into any higher-tier items.</p>
            <h4>Mythic</h4>
            <p>These items are similar to Legendary items: they provide the greatest stats and a significant special effect, but additionally provide stats for completed legendary items. Only one item of this tier can be equipped at a time.</p>
